While I was testing some of the blue rendering modifications for the [Portra 160NC Aperture 3 preset pre-release](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/08/13/kodak-portra-160nc-aperture-3-preset/) I obviously was looking for images with various hues of blue to see how they played under various WB, lighting conditions, etc. Here's one that was an obvious test candidate. Just for those curious for the recipe this is Portra 160NC shadow tone, contrast+, and that's it. I also wanted to test some of the orange skin add-ons so I did not do a WB correction and just went through the run of them, this one is *orange skin color shift* which does a couple of other mods that people may find more to their skin tone taste. Maybe not. That's not what this post is about though. It's about photo geeky-ness. Admit it we all have it.

This is one of a series of images I did last winter. Remember all the [inordinately long posts on the merits of various shutter speeds](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/07/28/slow-shutter-vsco-aperture3-etc/) when doing motion blur stuff? Well this just happens to show one of the little magical photo geek things that can happen if you are paying attention and choosing various shutter speeds to produce effects you are going for. All motion blur is **not** create equal.

Check out what 1/8 happens to do with my chosen subject, shooting distance, and lens selection. Seemingly impossible results in camera. If you open up the shot at the top you can see all the pixels for yourself. It's a 100% magnification. See the really sharp parts of the blue jacket right next to really blurry ones? Now take a good look at Anastasia's face and the glasses and especially her eye/eyelashes closet to the camera. Impossible right. Motion blur on most of the face, some portions of the glasses but not of the eye or eyelashes… neeto keano in a very photo-geek kinda way huh?

The cool thing is this is not a one off affair. I would say a good 50% of the shots I made of this scene exhibit the exact same kind of thing. Very cool. It's not DOF effects causing this trust me. You can see that for yourself if you think about it. The sharp part of the jacket is in front of the eye the sharp part of the glasses on the right are behind the eye - not DOF. I was shooting close to f/8 anyway and had almost her whole depth in focus anyway.

Just thought some of you would find this cool. As a side note I did practice a whole lot with a subject in motion at approximately "model speed" at the same distance and same lens. I had a really good feel for timing before I shot these. I hate being unprepared for a shoot. I really like the glasses they were what I was going to do. I shot a grand total of two of them and decided to loose them because I just could not pay attention to timing and what was going on in the reflections at the same time. Even now I am iffy about the 2 shots I made with the glasses on how the reflections play. Food for thought regarding complexity and how much YOU can actually pay attention to while shooting. Alternatively you could just say screw it and let the chips fall where they may. I do that sometimes but I was time pressured here as I had other irons in the fire.
