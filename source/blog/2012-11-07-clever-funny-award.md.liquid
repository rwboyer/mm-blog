I am declaring myself the final and only arbiter of the clever/funny award of the month. The very first person to receive this prestigious honor is [Gregory Simpson of UltraSomething](http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography/) for his third and final post of the Leica Monochrom review.

Specifically while discussing the contrast characteristics of the OOC files produced by the Leica Monochrom he produced this this delicious little bit of humor that is right up my alley. Simulated at the top of the post as I don't have his permission to use the original illustrative image. You can see the original by [scrolling down a bit here](http://blog.leica-camera.com/photographers/blog-contributors/fegor-a-fetishists-guide-to-the-monochrom-part3/).

Enjoy
