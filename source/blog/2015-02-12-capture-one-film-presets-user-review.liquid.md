I’m always a little apprehensive regarding the release of any eBook or presets or anything like that. I always expect to get some sort of “What the hell?” feedback from anyone that grabs them. More often than not I get comments and feedback that verge on the embarrassingly gushing positive. Here’s one I asked if I could publish here along with a few photos an early user sent to me.

> I’m seriously loving these presets. Honestly man, I think these are the best out there - and I’ve definitely used them all.

That along with all the photos is from [S Kevin Longo](http://flickr.com/photos/kevinlongo "Kevin Longo Photographys"). I think the images are great he’s @skevlongo on twitter. Image at the top [Kodak BW400CN-](http://store.rwboyer.com/page/503 "Film emulation presets for Capture One")

Above was Kodak PLUS-X. So’s the next one.

Here’s one using Kodak PLUS-X soft blacks.

Kevin goes on to ask about additional presets for Capture One… Yes they’re coming. Based on request some color negative films are next up. Quite a few of you have asked me about doing these as well as my color stuff for Lightroom as well. I can, and I might but want to know if it’s okay/clear than I cannot match up the film-grain response as well in LR… the grain absolutely will be [completely different and not as close to the real thing](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2015/02/11/film-grain-capture-one-exposure-dxo-etc/ "Film Grain Emulation")… If that’s okay, I’ll go ahead and put in the effort but I do want them to be useful to those that have switched over to Lightroom. Let me know.
