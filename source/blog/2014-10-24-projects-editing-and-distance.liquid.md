I spent another hour this morning going though my semi-insane but illuminating edit process for a long-term project. The term *edit* used in the sense of cull, choose, etc. rather than modify, manipulate, or choose a particular look. To summarize, my edit process starts from scratch every time, looking at the entirety of what I shot on a particular day. I compare that go-around to the last time I went through them all. What I’m looking for is a consistent set of choices that have months of time between each. Today I found stasis ion a particular group of images shot a little over a year ago.

Sounds great but now the really hard part comes. I don’t have a target number I need from any particular occasion. I don’t even have a target for how many images the project will ultimately contain. I have an loose idea. I know for certain I don’t want anywhere near 47 from any particular occasion My gut tells me more like five. The pile will sit for a while before I attempt to decide. I may even look at those 47 in the context of other sets reaching the same steady-state. A much better idea than attempting to force some really small number looking at one subject on one particular day in isolation. 

Culling that forty-seven down do something that makes any sense has many challenges that increase exponentially when folding in the dozens of other subjects I’ve photographed for the project. Those come in a few different forms. The image at the top of the post serves as a reasonable illustration of one challenge. Without context or juxtaposition it doesn’t communicate anything about what the project is about. Even if I did juxtapose it against something else It probably doesn’t work in the context of the project. Here’s the rub; I really like that one. It’s easy to force that picture into making sense when it doesn’t. I’ll contrast the red herring above with a couple that work much better but I don’t like as much.

Or maybe this one will work better depending on how I lay out the primary project presentation…

One thing I am sure of is that the top one that I *like the best* does nothing for communicating what is the core of questions and observations of the sole reason I’m working on this project in the first place. 

This image certainly works better — different day different but that should serve to clarify the conundrum a bit.

The funny part is that the above photograph may not make it into the final project. I’m not sure I like it enough. Depending on what you are trying to accomplish with a given project these kinds of things are actually the hard part. Making those editorial decisions on top of your aesthetic sensibilities. This particular one stands out but there are a lot that creep in that aren’t so easy to spot. One thing that helps is distance but this isn’t a sure fire thing.
