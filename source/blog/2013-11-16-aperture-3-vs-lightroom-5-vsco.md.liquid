Consider this post just for giggles. While trying to run down a little preview rendering bug that I noticed in Aperture 3 yesterday I was playing around with images that happened to be convenient. Those images just happened to be what I chose randomly for the [post on my *baseline*](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/11/15/aperture-3-updated/) Aperture 3 adjustments.

It crossed my mind that they looked a heck of a lot like those I processed in Lightroom 5 using VSCO film. Just for heck of it I brought up the same exact image in LR5 reset everything and slapped in a VSCO Fuji 400H preset - I then chose a neutral gray to ensure identical white balance across both RAW processors [since we can't do it by the numbers](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/11/14/white-balance-musings/).

You can see the result to the right. The image at the top left is the Aperture 3 image with that baseline I discussed. Huge difference? Nope, not really. Any color difference - a tiny bit. Mostly in the warmth pushed into the highlights - you can see it on the light colored walls and the window in the background the most. I could obviously do that in Aperture 3 as well I just left it as is though. I would say they are far more similar than they are different. I could reproduce the results exactly if I tried with a slightly different curves adjustment instead of my baseline.

Now here's the giggle worthy part. Way back when I offered my honest [opinion on VSCO for Aperture 3](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/01/22/VSCO-update/) I advised against it if you wanted anything near the results that you were seeing from the Lightroom version. Considering 99.9% of anything that could be considered examples out there are from Lightroom I still stand by that. In fact I remember saying that the default Aperture 3 rendering looked a whole lot more like VSCO film 400H in Lightroom than the corresponding VSCO for Aperture 3 preset did. You be the judge.

Take a look at the image here on the left. This is VSCO 400H for Aperture. Before you ask... Yes same exact white balance, etc, etc. Everything the same except the baseline I discussed previously vs the VSCO preset.

I bring this up for a couple of reasons other than amusement. First is that there are a lot of factors to consider when choosing a home base for your image processing work-flow. One of them really shouldn't be the *default* rendering characteristics if you are shooting RAW. As long as you know where you want to go just about anything with a few basic controls will get you there. If you absolutely need some image correction feature for 100% of your images or somewhere close obviously that will be a factor. If not then it's not that relevant. The other reason I bring this up is a few conversations I had with folks about some of my Aperture film presets. Specifically the likelihood that I will port them over to Lightroom. I haven't given a solid answer   beyond - ummm not right now.

I think the biggest reason is that I find VSCO completely acceptable - more than acceptable in the context of Lightroom and ACR. That's why I use them and why I'm a customer. It's pretty much a bunch of variations of where I would go anyway without me making a big mess and having to sort it out every version. I'm really not in the preset business - if I were I would probably make a really slick website to market them and charge at least 10x the $4.99 I do. Honestly presets in the context of a RAW processor aren't brain surgery. With basic controls like curves you can pretty much reproduce within a hair of what you see that was processed in any other RAW processor. Give it a try yourself. It's probably a decent educational endeavor for yourself in many ways. If you are having trouble give me a shout and I'll see if I can provide any useful guidance. It's probably more important that you get a grip on things like the curves tool - generically and how to produce the result you want rather than depending on some random default that a product produces anyway. 

Have a great weekend.
