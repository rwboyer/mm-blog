If you wonder or are dismayed at my silence regarding Apple’s Announcement signaling the end of Aperture development you’re not alone. As of the announcement I’ve received dozens of emails that can be summarized as *”What now?”*. Candidly, I really had to take a step back and get some perspective myself. As most people, I was surprised. Upon reflection the move is really not so surprising. 

The silence is over. My viewpoint and prognostications will be published in an idiotically long essay over on [ApertureExpert.com at noon PST today](https://www.apertureexpert.com). Meanwhile amuse yourself with [my little rant on *tools* from way back](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/08/04/2013-aperture-3-still-my-go-to-tool/). I still feel the same today.
