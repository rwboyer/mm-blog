This is just a post to help an eBuddy that is not liking ACR for his X-TRANS processing for various reasons evaluate if Aperture 3 might give him what he's looking for. These are screenshots of Ap3 running on a 27" monitor zoomed into 100%. They are **not** carefully engineered to demonstrate any particular thing. They are typically real world X100S use for me. The camera that's with me all the time and used mostly for snapshots wide open or close to it. If you want to see them in all their pixels right click and open in a new window.

These represent the first things I ran across that have bothered me in the past with various X-TRANS RAW processing - in fact I have even had some in-camera JPEG's cause issues with some things like this…

Like foliage at certain spacial frequencies…

and hair…

some more hair.

This fabric is extremely fine - not coarse so this is a very subtle thing and typical of where I think Aperture 3 does a very decent job. Crazy fine detail…

Same fabric slightly different light and view.

If anyone would care I could possibly engineer something to spec that you care to see in terms of how Aperture 3 handles a particular thing at a particular distance and aperture just let me know…
