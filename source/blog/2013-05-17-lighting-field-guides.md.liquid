Nothin' like a little shameless self-promotion so here it is. Actually this is better than self-promotion it's a [reasonably rational review](http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2013/5/11/simulating-sunlight-?utm_content=bufferc32e4&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer) by a great photographer - Patrick LaRoque - of my newest lighting field guide [*simulating sunlight*](http://store.rwboyer.com). I probably would have written a similar kind of thing if I would have reviewed it. My review would have used a whole lot more words and sounded a little less ummmm… gushing but I did absolutely **love** one of the quotes - very much my kind of assessment. 

>if it sucked I wouldn't be writing about it. <cite>Patrick LaRoque</cite>

That's fair. Actually funny because I have been seriously thinking about branding for about a year. The driving force I keep coming back around to is pretty much "Stuff that sucks less" - that's just the way I am wired.

Actually Patrick did use a lot of stuff that I couldn't possibly bring myself to say that was quite flattering and I really do appreciate his kindness and praise as well as his taking the time to give the eBook a shout-out on his blog. All kinds of flowery stuff like this… 

>Everything in this book is done with a single speedlight and believe me, the depth of what can be achieved is quite impressive. Just goes to show how much you can accomplish once you've mastered the primary concepts.

and…

>Robert possesses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of light and isn't afraid to share. He covers everything from lighting ratios to controlling spill, simulating windows, controlling the edge of shadows, creating patterns...

even this…

>In fact, some of these experiments made their way to a few client shoots recently. Anything this inspiring should be required reading.

High praise indeed. I am almost embarrassed.

In case you don't follow his [Patrick Laroque's blog](http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/) - you should. I don't say that often as you know. It's one of the couple that I do. What's more is it happens to be the **only** blog without an  RSS feed that I regularly visit. I actually go there at least 3 times a week to see what he's been up to. He definitely makes photographs that don't suck.

Ps. I may be mistaken regarding the RSS feed - I haven't looked for one in a while and might be too daft or lazy to actually find it in the 4 seconds that I looked for one a while ago. It doesn't matter I manually subscribe anyway…
