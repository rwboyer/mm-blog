So feeling a little depressed? No VSCO love for Aperture 3? Well I'm here to save the day. Well maybe not save the day. While I am waffling back and forth and pondering, and second guessing how to package up some of the stuff I use in Aperture 3 for "film looks" in some reasonable semblance of order for something I would actually use without adjustments on import on certain cameras I figured I would treat all of you to my sorta-semi-recolection of how Fuji Astia kinda sorta looked when I used to shoot it - kinda. Hey it's free so just let the complaint department down in the comments know if it's all screwy from your POV. If you like it - hey man, let me know. It might motivate me to actually get in gear on the stuff I actually use all the time in Aperture 3.

So take your mouse and right click on [this right here](/images/2013/08/RBCO-Astia-100-ish.AdjustmentPresets.zip). Unzip, open it up in Aperture 3. Have a blast ranting and raving over it's wonders or how screwed up I am… your choice.

Warning - use at your own risk. This particular preset is pretty much designed and tested on a whopping dozen or so images from my X-Trans based Fuji. If you use it on ANYTHING other than an X100S, XPro-1, or XE-1 Fuji camera I will assure you it will look completely different than what I intended. I tested that on my Nikon… so have fun. If you *really* want to motivate me head on over to the [eBook store](http://store.rwboyer.com/) and grab one of the lighting field guides or maybe my particular take on how to use Aperture 3 from a workflow point of view.
