A little slim on the posts this week. Real work, writing field guides, etc got in the way. Time for one short post before I leave to hopefully do my last sessions to close out the next lighting field guide. Oh - that rememinds me. Only a few days left for the [VSCO film pack give-away](). I will be randomly selecting a winner this coming Tuesday.

I just wanted to introduce a new series of posts I will be releasing here and there over time. For now I'll just call it the *perspective* series. Nope, has nothing to do with visual perspective. It has everything to do with perspective on pursuing this art and craft of photography.

A few of you are of my generation. Many more of you are of my children's generation. I have been at this whole photography thing for quite a while. All the while I have been back and forth over some of the same ground. Every once and a while I break some new ground. All of us are at differing points in our own photographic journeys but I think this series will prove enlightening and entertaining for just about everyone.  

Some posts will be extremely brief - some may be fairly long essays or even diatribes. Check out the scanned article at the top. This is from a popular publication of my youth. You know what I am going to say about this right? Just so you don't guess wrong - here we go…

There has always been some sort of unnatural fascination with pixel-peeping. That term is new - the activity is not. The really funny part is that the article describes this insane fascination even way way back then. You might be amused at the couple of lenses they chose to matchup. I'll leave that as an exercise for you to check out. The magnification they are looking at is insane - even more than most of you can pixel-peep at this point. You would need about 50 megapixels to look at on your typical 100dpi screen. Funny shit. Check out the films they are using - two normal ones and two special purpose ones. I was a user of the two normal ones until they went away but actually preferred the K64 for lots of reasons. I am shocked they didn't include Techpan… 

A couple of observations. This is 35mm film in the 70's with 70's glass. Amazing and barely approached now - oh but it does have *noise*. The Nikon appears to me to be "better" than the Leica. The biggest observation of all is "who cares?". Seriously do you care about any of the differences between the lenses and the films at this point? Are the images fantastic? No and No.

I sure sells magazines though - even today this is what drives massive amounts of web traffic. That's shit like this dominates the web today for things that allegedly are about photography - which none of this is. Most serious photographers grow out of this crap - hopefully. The right tool for the right job with characteristics that actually matter for what you are trying to accomplish - which shouldn't be taking what even then were boring images of nothing so you can look at them under a microscope. We all get sucked in. Really - don't - especially if you have outgrown this. 

It's amazing to see how far we have **not** come as a little sub-culture isn't it? One giant circle of bullshit and I am just starting to get my highlight rendering back. God what a distraction from producing anything that matters…

Ps. If you haven't guessed the perspective series is all about nothing new under the sun…
