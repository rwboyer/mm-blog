Forgot all about this. It Arrived the other day and it has been sitting here since I have been focused on getting that first lighting series eBook out the door. I bought a 50mm autofocus lens for the first time. [Remember the last time I tried that?](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2012/11/30/nikon-50mm-105mm/). I ended up not being able to decide and got a [Nikon 105DC](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LEOK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00005LEOK&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20) instead.

Well this time I didn't even think about it. Just went strait to Amazon and hit the one-click gimmie-it button. Strange things happen when I think about stuff too carefully. Normal people usually end up thinking it through and decide they don't need it. That would be fine but once I saw the $100 instant Nikon rebate on an already reasonably priced lens I was in buy mode. 

Once in buy mode if I started thinking it through I would be all over the map and end up buying something nutty like the 35mm AFS 1.4G N and a bunch of other letters. So no though process. I am going to test it out today. Prolly needs some AF-fine tuning so I will sort that and be confident when I go out to use it. Maybe I'll use it for the [LaRoque challenge](https://patrick-laroque.squarespace.com/blog/2013/2/15/a-challenge-a-shower-a-leaf-shutter). Thinking about using the location at the top of the post for that as well. Maybe not. Looks dangerous - or at least the fellow I imagine is upstairs with using that sat dish.

I got the last one and it arrived in one day, even with cheapo shipping. Maybe there are [more now](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVA0U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001GCVA0U&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20). At $340 how could I go wrong get one if you are remotely thinking about it. I just looked on Amazon and provided the link above. Looks like the deal is still on but the prices went up because they are selling a lot of them and for some reason a few of the listings don't have the rebateâ€¦ check again. It seems to change by the second.

Have a great weekend.
