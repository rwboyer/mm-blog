So who wants a really really great deal on a perfectly good [Fuji X100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0043RS864&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20)? It works fine, two great batteries, a brand new never used lens cap, takes really good pictures, it's really fun. Heck I liked it way better than my [X-Pro-1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006UV6YMQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006UV6YMQ&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20) - that's while it's still here. So why would I sell it? 

Well… In one of my minute to minute flip-flops on [X100S](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20) or **not** I happened to be too close to the *buy it now button* so boom - I am now in line to receive one when they finally ship in the USA. WTF? How can I buy them from people in freaking Hong freaking Kong for like the last month? Boats really take that long? Really? Bullshit.

In any case I will probably not put it on eBay and probably won't let it go until my new one gets here and I am sure it works okay but I really could not stand to be without one for too long. Like a day. If nobody wants and I judge that I cannot find a decent home for it then maybe I will just keep it in case the old one breaks or something - but cameras that never get used really bother me. They make me feel guilty or something… Let me know if you have a good home for it.

Oh one other thing - only a week left for the [VSCO film pack give-away](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/02/26/VSCO-give-away/). If you haven't grabbed a copy of my the first in a series of [lighting field guides](http://store.rwboyer.com/page/601) do it soon. Heck - a bargain at twice the price - well at least that is what a couple of kind hearted people have told me. Next one is coming soon. I **might** be done shooting illustrations for it this coming Monday - maybe. I guess that's what happens when you change course mid-stream and decide that the whole thing needs to be re-sorted and is too complicated to start off with… The first one is one and only one light. Definitely best to start with. 

Too bad I accidentally got carried away shooting for it in January and February and went way way overboard with stuff a lot of people are just not going to bother with until they get hooked… or are luny like me. I hope another couple of dedicated days will do it.
