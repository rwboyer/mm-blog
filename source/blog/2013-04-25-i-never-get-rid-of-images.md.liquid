I never delete images, especially in camera. Probably a hang-up from my film days in more than a few ways. Getting rid of one image in the middle of a roll was more trouble than it could possibly be worth. Why would anyone bother? More so, as I gained some perspective with time a lot of shots I payed **no** attention to, never printed, became quite interesting for me. Some of them are actually my favorite images now.

I don't shoot in continuos drive. I probably shoot more images than most normal people do maybe on the high-end of what serious film shooters shot with film and definitely on the low-end in terms of "serious" digital shooters do as a matter of course now. So my non-deletion policy is really not all that bad from a number of terabytes consumed per annum measurement. The image at the top is nothing too too special but I definitely like it for some reason I just cannot put my finger on. I didn't realize this until today and I shot it a month ago did my selects and moved on. It probably would have been sent to the digital trash pile in the sky by most of you given the circumstances of it's existence in the first place.

Here is a quick version of the story. I was shooting with determination to make a few specific images. Not this one. This was the very last image I shot that day. I didn't plan on shooting it. The whole reason it exists is because Fayette was kind of new to any serious modeling and I took the opportunity to discuss some hopefully helpful advice when working with various photographers. I noticed a few things that she was doing during our session that I thought might be an impediment for other photographers that weren't experienced in working with people. Without repeating that entire discussion I made a few demonstration snapshots. This was the very last one I made.

I happened to be showing her what various distances from the camera looked like in terms of perspective. Yea yea yea that's the photographers job but we were talking about workshops… the range of shooters in workshops runs the gamut from never before pointed a camera at an actual person to people that have been doing it for decades. Too bad for the model that a lot of less experienced photographers don't even know how to judge how "good" a model is. Fact is most judge entirely on how their own images look so… it's a good idea for models that work with a wide variety of photographers understand what they look like from various perspectives and uuuhhh hummmm… compensate for things that might not look so good.

One of those things is shitty perspective like shooting extremely close as you see above. The demonstration was some things she might do in these situations - especially if she is not being instructed otherwise. Like pointing your nose away from someone that is only 2 feet away as I was in these circumstances. Enough of that. The point is I was making really bad images on purpose so that she could understand distance and perspective from a model's point of view. This was her pointing her nose away from the looming 50mm lens that was in her face. She liked it better than the horrible one I am not showing you. So did I.

A perfect example of throw-away images that I didn't throw away. We happened to chat today because she was looking for some images for her own promo purposes and wanted to know if she could have/use some of the ones we made that day since she liked them and they aren't all tarted up to make her look differently than she actually looks. That's a pretty important thing to be able to show perspective modeling clients. That's how I came across this one and realized I actually like it - a lot - even though I didn't make it for any reason and considered it throw-away.

If you are a super high volume shooter obviously you know what you are doing - I hope. If you are a more moderate volume image maker you may want to re-think your trash policy given the idiotically low cost of storage these days.
