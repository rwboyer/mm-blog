My first *10 things you can do with a speedlight* workshop disaster was entirely attributed to shoving 85lbs of camera gear into one of those little Domke F-803 bags. Remedy; Split the workshop up into a series of easy to swallow 2 to 3 hour sessions that build on each other (hopefully). I just wrapped up the last of those sessions in the *Speedlight Series* on my first batch of victims. There are definitely things I’m going to change but most of that first edition is staying. The biggest challenge is **forcing participants** to fine-tune rather tha just using what I setup or more accurately left sitting there as the last version of a setup.

<!--more-->

I have some new ideas to force the fine-tuning, change it up, try different ratios, different blends of strobe/ambient, etc. The thing I’m not going to change is my backwards way of presenting exposure control. The first two sessions I demonstrate manual exposure control for both ambient and speedlights. Only in the third and final session is TTL exposure control introduced for the speedlights along with thoughts on why and a few tricks on the “how”.

During that concluding session just wrapped up I tried an attempt at forcing experimentation, fine tuning, and changing things around that was combined with the whole notion of *why TTL* — convenience and speed. I set up lights **wrong** and used inappropriate ratios for the matter at hand. I then proceeded to get to a different (better place depending on how you look at things) finally I went back to “**wrong**”, doing things I would never do for the intent of a particular setup. Guess what happened… Still no dice. Well, not as much participant fine-tuning as I would have like to have seen. I’m an ardent believer that doing is far different from mere academic understanding. Oh well, I have some additional schemes the next time around.

Why TTL flash control? In my world it’s for speed, flow, working alone without an assistant, and convenience of fine tuning results. I  demonstrated this by using two speedlights. One behind with a modifier to narrow it and control spill — snoot, grid, barndoors — I forget. The other speedlight was in front with a shoot-thru umbrella on a stand. I started **way too high** and way too far away and way too much from one side. As with most situations like this that stand w/ umbrella was within arms reach. Without a lot of fuss I proceeded to grab the stand and jerk it to and fro, back and forth *while I was taking pictures with the other* hand. Ta…Da…, no muss, no fuss, fine tuning lighting direction and distance on the fly without having to reset power levels.

The entire 2 minute demonstration of fast and loose one handed re-setting of the main light, one handed shooting, alternately holding a reflector in various positions, was accompanied with a long list of I wouldn’t do this, instead I would do that, or if I did this I would use a reflector like so… etc. etc.  w
Wrapping up the quick and dirty demonstration, the main light was back at too high, too far, too much from the side. At that point everyone else took a turn one by one. Results? Hmmmm, not as much fine tuning as I would have liked to see but I shut the hell up for the most part. I did have to say; “You might want to try some variations on that” a couple of times which usually provoked nothing near my intent. I’ll figure that part out. 

Something interesting did come out of that though. A shot or two of extremely *wrong and funky* test/demo shots I would **never do** based on the intent I kinda sorta like. Not the image as a whole but a few of the elements that are going on. Some things I’m actually going to put in a box of stuff for anther day on another project, with a different intent.

The shot at the top is one such demo of *wrong-ness* that has a few intriguing elements that are floating my boat. Let’s count up the *”I never do this”* inventory:

- Never would I shoot a headshot this tight with a 50mm on FX. Not with Carly and her features.
- Never ever would I shoot this high of a lighting ratio, light this high and pure rembrandt. Not for a tight headshot. More of a full-length fashion setup maybe.
- I would definitely dump tons of fill in if for some reason I was nuts enough to do a female close-up like this.
- If I were serious, I would use either one of those IR only triggers even if doing TTL as opposed to the built-in flash as a master. Even with it “off” you’ll still get that pin-prick of reflection in anything reflective like eyes (also mentioned how much I hate that and would spot it out — left it in for illustration and laziness)
- Would tone down the sharp edge light on the shadow side by a stop and a half or two. It will still show up because that side’s going towards black anyway. **Anything** is going to have shitloads of contrast against almost black.

Funny part is that I actually said all this, and corrected each in 6 differing ways from paramount light to silver reflector, to messing with the exposure comp on the rim light. What I didn’t say was…

- I just show up and shoot but I would never have that whimpy skinny-ass bullshit chain/pendant screwing with my ability to frame.
- I would grab a hair stylist and get rid of all those fly-aways with **any rim light**.
- I hate that fabric.
- The rest of the 1,000 things that go through my head when shooting.

Whatever, there are some interesting things about all this stuff I would never do I’m actually going to do in a different context. I guess the good thing was participants did actually see what the word *close* really means when talking about lights and modifiers like shoot-thru umbrellas. Too bad all of them had pieces of umbrella in frame I could see flashing up on auto-chimp screens. Yes, I mentioned that too. I guess the heat of the moment causes instant reversion. A few tru-isms to consider from all this. Try stuff that *”doesn’t work”* worst case it will spark ideas to build on — even if you do this a lot. Two, you have to actually spend time making pictures so that all of the academic stuff that get’s said and understood *just happens*.
