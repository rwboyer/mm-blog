Did you see the price reduction on the [Fuji XE-1 Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092MD5ZE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0092MD5ZE&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20) in the last day or so? This really will push the prices down on the used ones for sure. Hell the used ones haven't even *caught up* to the price of a **new** kit. Yea right - anyone is going to buy a used one for the same as a brand new kit let alone more. This along with the drop in OMD-EM5 prices that will continue for the next month or more has put me in sort of a dilemma. Therefore I need some assistance…

Now both of these cameras have fallen below my threshold of *who cares* and both have the potential to act as a place holder for my own wish and desire. Of course that desire is a yet to exist X200/X300 Fuji camera that is the same thing as the X100 but with a 50mm FOV and/or a 90mm FOV that is the same size as the X100. Perfect for me. I could take two of the little guys and confidently do real work. Truth be told I am very comfortable working with two bodies (small) with two primes. I would do a trip like my DC trip in a heartbeat with two X100 sized cameras and two primes. Sans camera bag!

Now that I can have either of these two and plop a 50/90 FOV equivalent on either and not really exceed my size threshold either may work as a stand-in for my true desire. The OM-D winning out on the size front being really really close to the same size as the X100S with a prime. So now that I have this in my head it's not going to go away.

Which one would you go with as a placeholder - single prime until Fuji gives me what I really want… Hands down it *would be* the [OM-D](http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Interchangeable-3-0-Inch-Tilting-Touchscreen/dp/B0074WDFHM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1380718492&sr=8-2&keywords=omd+em5) with the [45mm f/1.8](http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Zuiko-Digital-Panasonic-Cameras/dp/B00CI3R53W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1380718550&sr=8-2&keywords=olympus+45+1.8) all things being equal because of the size, quality/speed of that lens, etc… and the ability to slap a 50 equiv lens on it and still be small but there is one fly in the ointment. That fly would be the aspect ratio of Micro 4:3. If I mixed the two cameras I would have to either frame for a more square-ish ratio on the X100S or a more long-ish ratio on the OM-D and then crop one or the other to match… assuming I am not shooting for a single image - which I am not most of the time. That's the only reason I don't pull the trigger right now. The XE-1 is bigger but not too too big - the deal killer is the size of the 35/1.4 and the 60/2.4… now we are in the nit category vs the D600 and 50/1.4. My rules, my size threshold - yours might be different.

Which one would you pair with the X100 to get either that 50 or 90 FOV? Should we have a vote? Thoughts?

Ps. Image at the top shot on my little Fuji X100S. Consider it a preview for what I think is a very very interesting series of posts for all of you here. Let's call it project contact sheet. This series of images I made recently may find it's way into one of my personal projects started earlier this year. This is the basic treatment I have settled in on for the project. More to come.
