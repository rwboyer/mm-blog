Okay, after the last two extremely long posts here's a really short one for Sunday before I head out. The second installment of [project contact sheet](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2013/10/09/project-contact-sheet-i/). At this point I don't have any images from this set narrowed down to which couple might get used in the final project but here's the raw material. Same treatment as before. I probably won't change it up a whole lot until I am farther down the road.

As usual shoot me an [email](mailto:rwboyer.com) if you would like to subscribe to the iCloud photostreams. If not you can see the full set [here on the web](https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#A35CmvASj3l4X).

This was shot the same day as the last one but between a quick wardrobe change-up for some of my outdoor [X100S](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ATM1MVA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ATM1MVA&linkCode=as2&tag=rbde-20) experiments.  You might notice I gravitated far more towards shooting the little Fuji here. Also note what else changed a few shots into this group. I did eliminate a bunch of images that seemed to much like a make-up ad as well as some of the less clothed shots as I know I won't use any in this project. 

As usual and comments or questions are welcome either in the photostream or here on the blog. I'll try to get another installment out shortly.
