Okay, I know a few of you were chomping at the bit for the Ilford HP5 Plus 35mm film borders. You would not believe how tedious this kind of thing is. Mind numbing actually. Personally I think the Kodak Tri-X edge printing is far prettier but popular demand HP5 had to be next up. Here they are…

Just [download this zip file right here](#) and they’re all yours. I did add a couple of bonus goodies for this set. Specifically strips of 5 already connected together. Seven of them total. The whole point of having a bunch of different frame numbers and strips with various frame numbers and markings is to use them with a real project instead of just one-offs. As usual let me know if you need any *”how-to”* help. They are of enough resolution to scale up to 36 megapixel D800 files if you need. I tested them and they look great. 

I did leave them a little *ratty* for a more authentic feel.

If you find them at all useful or just wanna be a nice guy/gal paypal donations to rwboyer@mac.com to help cover my bandwidth costs are always welcome. 

Enjoy!
