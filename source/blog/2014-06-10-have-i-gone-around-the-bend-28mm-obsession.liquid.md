If you’ve been following my [recent *discovery* of how the 28mm field of view](http://photo.rwboyer.com/2014/05/15/50mm-guy-finds-new-obsession/ "My New Obsession -- The 28mm") fits with the way I see the world you might think I’ve become a tad obsessed. If not then this news might change your mind. Ready? I purchased two more manual focus 28mm Nikkor lenses over the weekend. One’s already here. Obviously I just had to make some pictures of StupidCrap™ as soon as it arrived. Here’s my first impressions of my \<s\>new\</s\> old lens.

Hold on, let’s back that up. What **two 28mm lenses** you ask and why both? I set out with a specific lens in mind. The much lauded Nikkor 28mm f/2.8 AiS. I ended up with that lens as well as the equally praised 28mm f/2.0 AiS. How did that happen? Both were far less expensive that I thought they would be. Better yet both are pristine. Maybe I got lucky but I could swear they were a bit more expensive last time I looked. I grabbed both for under $500. Without a doubt the first $250 spent on the f/2 is the best money I’ve spent in a very long time. With only a few crappy shots under my belt I already know I love this thing.

Shot at the top is wide open. I love the way this lens looks. I love that how it renders is flexible to a large degree as well — like most older optics. The combinatinon of spherical aberration and coma give it a glow wide open. Here’s a closer obligatory 100% view for your inspection (open in a new window to see the native pixels).

I don’t judge lens rendering based on the typical *bokeh* criteria of which particular lens looks less awful when provoking horrid looking OOF backgrounds. Various renderings look really good in various situations. Instead I get an overall impression of of how a lens looks in a lot of contexts and it usually falls into like, don’t care, or hate. This one is absolutely already in the like category.

Hey, wait a second, that spherical and coma thing is *bad* right… it makes corners go softer wide open. Umm, yes but getting rid of those things may make a lens that test well but looks not so great for your aesthetic sensibilities. In any case ninty percent of that just goes away at f/2.8 and by f/4 it looks great technially while still rendering focus transitions to my liking. Here’s f/4.

Of course a closer view as well. For reference I was focusing on that leaf.

I can’t wait to have the other little beasty in my hot non-so-little hands. I’ll provide ongoing impressions as I use them in various circumstances. My guess is that I’ll like one more than antoher depending on what I’m making, how I’m shooting, where I stand, differing lighting conditions, etc, etc.
